# Web Exploit and Patch Project

In this project you will be looking for vulnerabilities in a realistic website. You will also be learning how to address those vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will be from the following categories:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   * Reflected and stored
* Vulnerable web APIs
* SQL injection

You will be attacking these vulnerabilities on the [Juice Shop website](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/) provided by OWASP.

## Running

To start, visit the [Juice Shop information website](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/). You will need to follow the instruction on [running OWASP Juice Shop](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/running.html) to get this project setup and running. Personally, I recommend that you run Juice Shop using docker. This can be done with a single command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=unsafe bkimminich/juice-shop
```

## Hints

* Start by getting familiarized with the application. Create a user account and maybe make an order or two.
* If you need to enter information, such as a credit card number or an address, remember that Juice Shop only has very basic data validation. As long as the data looks right, that is good enough. No need to use real values.
* A good place to start looking is in `main.js`.
* Another great resource is the developer tools for your browser.
   * In particular, use the network tab to look at the requests being made by the website during normal operation.
   * In the network tab, you can copy previous web requests into many different formats. This makes it easy to replicate or modify those requests.
   * If you need to encode a URL, you can use `encodeURIComponent` in the developer tools console.
* API-Only XSS
   * What is a [bearer token](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_for_Java_Cheat_Sheet.html)?
   * How are HTTP methods used by default for a [REST API](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)?
 * Database Schema
   * You need a SQL injection attack that returns data. Where could that be? Maybe in the API?
   * First figure out how to cause an error that will reveal information about the SQL engine and query.
   * To create a valid SQL command, you will need to close any quote-delimited strings. You will also need to close any parentheses pairs.
   * What does [UNION](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_union.asp) do in SQL? What might you want to union to get the database schemas?
      * It's engine specific and Google is a good place to find the correct table.

## Writeup
As you solve each problem, you will write up details about your solutions in `submission.md`. This is the file that you will submit on Canvas. When describing your steps, use complete sentences and describe clearly what you did.
